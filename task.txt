Recruitment task:

Create an Infrastructure as a Code terraform script that passes these 6 points:

A resource group in the West Europe region called "recruitment-challenge". All resources should be deployed inside the resource group.
Create VNet called "recruitment-vnet" with settings:
address_space = 10.0.10.0/23
Subnet "recruitment-subnet" with the settings:
address_prefixes = 10.0.10.0/24
connect to the "recruitment-vnet" VNet

AKS Cluster called "recruitment-aks" with the settings:

default_node_pool:
name = recruitmentpool ?? to long (name must start with a lowercase letter, have max length of 12, and only have characters a-z0-9.)
autoscale enabled
Available zones: ?? i assume there is typo so i will use 3 zones
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 10
use subnet "recruitment-subnet"
System Disks - 256GiB
dns_prefix = "recruitment-dns-prefix"
identity = SystemAssigned

network_profile:
network_plugin = "azure"
dns_service_ip = "10.254.0.10"
docker_bridge_cidr = "172.17.0.1/16"
service_cidr = "10.254.0.0/16"

auto_scaler_profile:
scale_down_utilization_threshold = 0.8
skip_nodes_with_system_pods = false
skip_nodes_with_local_storage = false
role_based_access_control.enabled = true ?? it seems to be deprecated 

All cloud resources should use the below tags:
env: recruitment
name: AuthorFullName

The task can be resolved by any method.
The code can be delivered as a single file or reusable modules.
Please use the newer versions of terraform script and provider.
Terraform Backend should use a storage account - here, please prepare only a configuration template - subscription, state name, (I don't have experience with blob storage(Yet) so im not quite sure if storage module is build correctly )
Please remember to use the best practices, as you know.
if any setting is required and hasn't been included, use the default values or values preferred by you
